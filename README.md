A) Projects:

**1. Design of FIFO**

Designed and implemented both synchronous and asynchronous FIFO (First In, First Out) memory systems using Verilog and simulated using ModelSim & EDA Playground.

Methodlogy: 

(i) Defined FIFO parameters and control signals. Implemented synchronous FIFO with one clock and asynchronous FIFO using interclock domain control data transfer to avoid multi-bit signal transitions.

(ii) Developed a comprehensive testbench to emulate the design environment, ensuring accurate functional and temporal validation.

**2. **RAM & ROM Verification****

Designed 64 bit X 8 bit single and dual port RAM, and 8 bit X 8 bit ROM and emulated the design with their comprehensive testbench. 

**3. Pomodoro-Based Study Timer and Productivity Logger using C++**

(i) A Pomodoro-style study timer application in C++ that manages user time effectively by tracking study sessions and
logging them with accurate timestamps. 

(ii) The application allows both fixed and custom timers, logs each session for future review, and reinforces time
management practices through simple command-line interaction

**4. Bashodoro – Pomodoro Timer in Bash**

Developed a command-line productivity tool implementing the Pomodoro technique, allowing users to manage work sessions, short breaks, and long breaks with customizable settings.
